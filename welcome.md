The event will start at **17:00** with a welcome drink and ceremony outside, followed by dinner and festivities inside.

Read more on our page for [practical information](extra_info.md).

### Dress code

Summery and relaxed - no strict dress code, just wear something nice. 

The ceremony will be held outside, so be aware that pleasant temperatures and clear skies cannot be guaranteed.

### Gifts

We know many of our guests are travelling far (and we live in a small flat) so we don’t expect any gifts. 

However, if you want to support the party and our honeymoon, or donate to a charity, that would be greatly appreciated. 
We will be making a donation to [Axel’s father’s memorial fund](https://www.cancerfonden.se/insamlingar/anders-hulterstroms-minne) at Cancerfonden. 

### Got a speech?

If you have something to say or do or show please contact our dear toastmaster Innokentij

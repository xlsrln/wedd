We’re happy to invite you to celebrate with us!

### RSVP

Please take a moment to fill in [this RSVP form](https://forms.gle/RiEzDVEoVMt6cr4t6), latest 1st June. It helps a lot with the organisation!

### Time and place

The event will take place at **Konditori Lyran** on the **first of July 2023**. Map link: [google maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Pxddppojkdf6eLzQ8)

The event will start at **17:00** with a welcome drink and ceremony outside, followed by dinner and festivities inside. The ceremony will start at 17:15 so it's better to be early than late! 

Read more on our page for [practical information](extra_info.md).

### Dress code

Summery and relaxed - no strict dress code, just wear something nice. 

The ceremony will be held outside, so be aware that pleasant temperatures and clear skies cannot be guaranteed.

### Gifts

We know many of our guests are travelling far (and we live in a small flat) so we don’t expect any gifts.

However, if you would like to make a contribution towards our honeymoon to Iceland, that would be greatly appreciated. (Swish 0793483369 or contact us for our bank details.) We will donate a portion of any contributions towards [Axel’s father’s memorial fund](https://www.cancerfonden.se/insamlingar/anders-hulterstroms-minne) at Cancerfonden. 

### Got a speech?
